## What is control flow?
> Control flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It determines the path of execution based on conditions and allows the program to make decisions and perform different actions accordingly. Control flow statements in JavaScript include conditionals (if, else if, else), loops (for, while, do-while), and other flow control constructs.

## What is a JavaScript function?
> A JavaScript function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It encapsulates a set of instructions and can accept input (parameters) and produce output (return value). Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
> To invoke or call a function means to execute the code inside the function and perform its intended task. When a function is called, the program flow jumps to the function definition, executes the code within the function's body, and then returns back to the point where the function was called.

An "assignment" operator in JavaScript is represented by the equals sign (=). It is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:

let num = 10;  

In this case, the value 10 is assigned to the variable num. The assignment operator can also be used to update the value of a variable:  

let num = 10;  

num = 20; // num is now 20  

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
>The information received from the user is typically referred to as "input" or "user input." In JavaScript, you can obtain user input through various means, such as using the prompt() function to display a dialog box and collect user input, or by interacting with HTML form elements.

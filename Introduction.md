# About Me

Hi! I'm  **Sarah Woolsey**. I recently resigned from educational leadership or pursue other opportunities in software development.  Although the two disciplines seem fairly disparate, I would like to design some educational applications (Reading/Vocabulary) in the future so I'm excited for the journey.

I live in Liverpool with my poochon puppy, Benji, but I'm hoping to move to Spain within the next couple of months so I need to really ramp up my Duolingo HP.

# Hobbies

I try new things all the time. Some of my favourites:
 - Solo travel
 - Private Pilot training (PPL)
- Dragon Paddle Boating
- Creative writing
- Reading (particularly dystopian/post-apocalyptic stuff)
- Open Mic Nights
- Playing Ukulele/Bass/Guitar (all badly)
- Board Games
- Cheese (This is a genuine hobby when you attend as many cheese tasting classes as I do)
- Pub Quizzes

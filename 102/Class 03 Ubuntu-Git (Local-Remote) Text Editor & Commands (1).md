# Ubuntu-Git (Local-Remote) Text Editor & Commands
## **Four important features to look for in a text editor are:**

- **User-friendly interface:** A good text editor should have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to navigate and edit text efficiently.

- **Syntax highlighting:** This feature helps to visually distinguish different elements in the code by applying different colors or formatting to keywords, variables, and other language-specific constructs. It improves readability and reduces errors.

- **Auto-completion:** Auto-completion suggests or completes code snippets as you type, based on the context or predefined templates. It saves time and helps in writing correct code.

- **Plugins and extensibility:** A text editor with a rich ecosystem of plugins and extensions allows users to customize and extend its functionality according to their needs, such as adding linters, version control integration, or additional language support.

## *As for the command line commands:*

- **pwd:** It stands for "print working directory." When executed, it displays the current directory (folder) path where you are located.

- **ls:** This command lists the files and directories (folders) in the current directory.

- **cd:** It stands for "change directory." This command allows you to navigate between directories. For example, cd projects would move you into the "projects" directory.

- **mkdir:** This command is used to create a new directory. For instance, mkdir new-project would create a directory named "new-project."

- **touch:** This command is used to create a new file. For example, touch new-project/newfile.md would create a file named "newfile.md" within the "new-project" directory.

## In the given scenario, the following commands and arguments are entered into the command line:

- **cd projects:** This command changes the current directory to the "projects" directory.

- **mkdir new-project:** This command creates a new directory named "new-project" within the "projects" directory.

- **touch new-project/newfile.md:** This command creates a new file named "newfile.md" within the "new-project" directory.

- **cd:** This command moves back to the parent directory.

- **ls projects/new-project:** This command lists the files and directories inside the "new-project" directory within the "projects" directory.

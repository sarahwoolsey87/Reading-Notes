# Node.js

[An introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

## What is node.js?

> Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser on various platforms, such as servers, desktops, and even IoT devices. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that makes it particularly well-suited for handling asynchronous operations, like network requests and file I/O, efficiently.

## What is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a high-performance, open-source JavaScript engine developed by the Chromium project (the open-source project behind the Google Chrome browser). V8 is designed to execute JavaScript code quickly and efficiently. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code, utilising just-in-time (JIT) compilation techniques, optimizing performance for modern applications.

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

When it's said that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it means that it provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of the browser. In the browser, the JavaScript runtime is provided by the browser itself. However, Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling them to build web servers, command-line tools, and other types of applications that don't require a browser interface.

## What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to discover, install, and manage packages or libraries of reusable code published by other developers. It plays a crucial role in managing dependencies and making it easy for developers to share and reuse code.

## What version of node are you running on your machine?


## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

To install the 'jshint' library/package using npm, you would type the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

npm install jshint

## What is node used for?

Node.js is used for various purposes, including:

- **Building web servers:** Node.js is commonly used to create fast, scalable, and real-time web servers. Its non-blocking, event-driven nature makes it ideal for handling concurrent connections efficiently.

- **Command-line tools:** Developers can use Node.js to build command-line applications, such as build tools, utilities, and scripts, making it versatile beyond web development.

- **RESTful APIs:** Node.js is often used to build RESTful APIs, which allow communication between different software systems.

- **Real-time applications:** Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, collaborative tools, and other applications requiring instant updates.

- **Microservices:** Node.js is commonly used in microservices architectures, where different services work together to build a larger application.

- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Its lightweight and efficient nature make it suitable for running on IoT devices to handle data processing and communication tasks.

Overall, Node.js has become a popular choice for modern web development due to its performance, scalability, and the vibrant ecosystem of libraries and tools provided by npm.

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at the same workstation. One person, known as the "driver," writes the code, while the other person, known as the "observer" or "navigator," reviews each line of code as it is typed. The two roles switch frequently, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing. There are several reasons why pair programming is beneficial:

- **Higher Code Quality:** With two sets of eyes on the code, potential bugs and issues are more likely to be caught early, leading to higher-quality code.

- **Continuous Feedback:** Immediate feedback from the partner allows for quick code review and knowledge exchange, leading to faster improvements.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Pair programming facilitates the exchange of knowledge between team members. Junior developers can learn from more experienced ones, and fresh perspectives can lead to innovative solutions.

- **Improved Problem-Solving:** Combining different skill sets and perspectives often leads to more creative problem-solving approaches.

- **Reduced Siloing:** Pair programming helps break down information silos within a team by encouraging open communication and collaborative work.

- **Team Building and Communication:** It strengthens team relationships and communication skills as developers learn to work effectively together.

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

In my experience, the most beneficial aspect of pair programming has been knowledge sharing. It's incredible how much can be learned from a fellow developer during pair programming sessions. Not only do you learn about different coding techniques and patterns, but you also gain insights into problem-solving strategies and approaches to debugging.

## How does pair programming work?

Pair programming works by having two developers sit together at the same computer, one taking the role of the driver and the other as the observer. The driver is responsible for actually writing the code, while the observer reviews the code and offers suggestions, points out potential issues, and helps keep the larger picture in mind. The roles can switch frequently, typically every few minutes or based on the complexity of the task.

Here's a basic outline of how pair programming works:

- **Choose the Driver and Observer:** The developers decide who will be the driver and observer first. It can be based on their comfort levels with the codebase or the specific task at hand.

- **Set Goals:** The pair discusses the task and sets clear objectives for the programming session.

- **Switch Roles:** The driver starts coding while the observer actively reviews the code being written.

- **Continuous Communication:** Throughout the session, both developers communicate openly, discussing design decisions, potential improvements, and any challenges encountered.

- **Frequent Role Switching:** The pair switches roles regularly, typically every few minutes or based on predefined milestones, ensuring both developers are actively engaged.

- **Review and Refactor:** As the code is written, the pair collectively reviews and refactors it to improve quality and readability.

- **Wrap-up:** After completing the session or a significant portion of the task, the pair may conduct a brief retrospective to discuss the experience and identify areas for improvement.

Pair programming can be done in person or remotely, using tools that allow for collaborative coding and screen sharing. It's important to establish a positive and respectful atmosphere to make pair programming sessions enjoyable and effective.
